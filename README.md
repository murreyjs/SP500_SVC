## S&P 500 Prediction using Support Vector Machines

### Overview
This is a small Python program that uses a Support Vector Classification model on SPY daily stats (Open, Close, High, Low) in order to predict if the Closing price will increase the next day. The model is trained on the first 80% of available S&P 500 price data, and tested on the remaining 20%.

### Disclaimer
The original idea for developing this model was inspired by a YouTube video. I'm unable to find the video that helped my development of this model, but just wanted to add a disclaimer that not all of the ideas in this code are originally mine. This was just meant to be a fun practice project using machine learning. I will update the README if I'm able to find the original video that inspired this project :)
