## S&P 500 Prediction using Support Vector Machines

### Overview
This is a small Python program that uses a Support Vector Classification model on SPY daily stats (Open, Close, High, Low) in order to predict if the Closing price will increase the next day. The model is trained on the first 80% of available S&P 500 price data, and tested on the remaining 20%.
